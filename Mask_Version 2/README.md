# FABRIC-FRAME
## FRAME-FACE SHIELD

__Problem__: Now it's just glued    
__Need__: Fixing with mask, reversible, guaranteeing insolation and 3D printing    

## DIFFUSER
__Problem__: Fragile diffuser-valve connection    
__Need__: Improve the connection system with the valve     

- Study of printing parameters and thicknesses. Guarantee resistance with suitable thicknesses. 
- What are the stresses on the frame? Does it need a large thickness or a thin one with designed filling?
- Improve the elastic distribution system.
- Improve printability: problem with printers with a small printing plate.
- Improve ergonomics
